You are storing the thread in a field.
 If the method(readCommand()) is called in two threads,
 the readThread.start() can be called twice for the same thread. 
You need to ensure readCommand is not called 
multiple times and perhaps not start the readThread again
 if its already running. e.g. you can synchronized the method 
and check readThread before you start.



/* Another Solution */

A thread will throw the exception when calling start
 if the thread's state
 (as retrieved by Thread.currentThread().getState() is anything other than NEW.


public synchronized void start() {
    /*
     * A zero status value corresponds to state "NEW".
     */
    if (threadStatus != 0)
        throw new IllegalThreadStateException();
    group.add(this);
    start0();
    if (stopBeforeStart) {
        stop0(throwableFromStop);
    }
}
